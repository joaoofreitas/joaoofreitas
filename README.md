I'm a Portuguese 🇵🇹 Computer Science student with two degrees in electronics.

People that I work with say I'm talented. I call it hard work and sweat.

Started programming in 2016 with C++ applied to ATMega microcontrollers. Since there, I've been learning more languages and frameworks to develop my skills in this field. 

I've worked as a Software/Hardware developer in two companies, being one of them a research institute in Portugal.

Right now I'm working as an Applications Engineer at Unipartner Portugal.

I always find to help people developing their projects and even try to contribute and use open-source as much as possible.

- 💻 I'm always learning and improving overtime, learning [go](https://github.com/golang/go), [java](https://www.java.com) and [.net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) on my __free time__. 
- 🧪 I will be glad to help you with anything you need, from coding to testing, just let me know what you need.
